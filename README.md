The Gitlet project is a local Java application that mirrors core version control functionalities akin to GitHub. It features essential commands such as commit, add, and checkout, streamlining the development workflow. The application introduces a persistence-based compression technique, ensuring efficient file storage and retrieval. Underpinning this functionality, a complex architecture using Trees, Linked Lists, Nested Arrays, and Graphs has been employed to emulate the branching capabilities found in GitHub, facilitating seamless navigation and management of multiple code versions.
